# Fact_Checker

Problem Statement
Given a document or a set of documents and a fact, this project decides whether the fact is true or false.

Approach
1.Multi document Summarisation -
i)Sentence Extraction 
ii)Redundancy checking
2.Build a negation of the fact using NLTK tools(POS tagging and then inverting)
3.Semantic Similarity of the fact and also its negation with the summary and comparison
